## 💡 Inspiration
This project was inspired by the need for efficient automation and AI-powered solutions in hackathon environments. Given our experience in Python development, DevOps, and automation, we wanted to build a scalable system that streamlines complex tasks like data validation, backend processing, and deployment automation.

## ⚙️ What It Does
This project is an AI-powered email classification system that categorises incoming emails based on their content. It uses machine learning to automate sorting, improve organisation, and enhance productivity.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Components & Technologies:
Email Processing: IMAP/SMTP, email-parser
OCR: Tesseract, AWS Textract, OpenCV
NLP & AI Models: Gemini, spaCy
Database:Microsoft Excel
Backend API: FastAPI, Flask
Frontend : Streamlit

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
Some challenges faced include handling imbalanced datasets, ensuring high classification accuracy, and optimising model performance for real-time predictions. Additionally, integrating the email processing pipeline with the backend while maintaining scalability and efficiency required careful architecture design.
